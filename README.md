# Voltage-Regulator-with-Series-Pass-Element
This is a project where I designed and simulated an analog voltage regulator with series pass element, featuring adjustable output (5-11V), thermal protection (120C) and overcurrent protection (0.5A). I implemented an error amplifier, reference voltage network and negative feedback, validated through simulations and completed the PCB design
